1️⃣ Context

The organization requires a forward-looking revenue outlook to support planning decisions under uncertainty. Historical retail revenue data exhibits long-term growth, strong annual seasonality, and exposure to macroeconomic shocks (e.g., 2008 financial crisis, COVID-19 disruption). Traditional point forecasts are insufficient for decision-making without explicit risk quantification.

To address this, a forecasting and scenario planning system was developed to translate revenue uncertainty into actionable planning guidance.

2️⃣ Forecast Summary (Base Case)

Using a time-series forecasting model with explicit trend and seasonality components, the expected 12-month base revenue is approximately:

Base forecast: ₹61.7L
Upside scenario: ₹63.1L
Downside scenario: ₹60.4L

The forecast reflects continued long-term growth with seasonal fluctuations consistent with historical patterns.

3️⃣ Downside Risk & Revenue-at-Risk

Uncertainty bands were used to quantify potential downside exposure.

Revenue at Risk (12 months): ~₹1.3L

This represents the gap between the base forecast and the lower-bound scenario.

While the absolute downside risk is moderate relative to total revenue, it is non-trivial and warrants proactive planning, particularly under adverse macroeconomic conditions.

4️⃣ Macroeconomic Stress Scenarios

To assess sensitivity to external shocks, post-forecast stress scenarios were applied:

Scenario	Assumption	12-Month Revenue Impact
Mild stress	−5% demand	Moderate revenue compression
Moderate stress	−10% demand	Noticeable revenue shortfall
Severe stress	−15% demand	Material planning risk

These scenarios do not attempt causal macroeconomic prediction. Instead, they stress-test revenue outcomes to evaluate decision robustness under worsening conditions.

5️⃣ Recommendation

Primary Recommendation:
Proceed with base-case planning while maintaining downside risk buffers.

Actions:

Avoid aggressive capacity expansion until stress scenarios improve.

Prioritize high-margin revenue streams and cost flexibility.

Maintain contingency plans that can be activated under moderate or severe stress signals.

If upside conditions materialize:
Selective growth investments can be justified without materially increasing risk exposure.

6️⃣ What Would Change the Decision

The current recommendation would be revisited if:

New data indicates sustained demand contraction beyond the moderate stress range.

Structural shifts reduce historical seasonality or trend persistence.

Additional exogenous indicators (pricing, promotions, macro data) materially alter forecast confidence.

7️⃣ Limitations & Next Steps

Limitations:

Forecasting is univariate; exogenous drivers are simulated, not modeled causally.

Monthly batch updates assume stable reporting cadence.

Next Steps:

Incorporate external indicators (e.g., pricing, CPI, promotions).

Automate scheduled retraining as new data arrives.

Extend scenario logic to segment-level forecasts.

Final Takeaway:

This system shifts forecasting from a predictive exercise to a decision-support framework, enabling leadership to evaluate revenue risk, stress-test plans, and act with greater confidence under uncertainty.
