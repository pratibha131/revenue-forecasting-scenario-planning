# Revenue Forecasting & Scenario Planning System

## Overview
This project builds an ML-driven revenue forecasting system designed for strategic planning.
Instead of focusing solely on prediction accuracy, the system enables scenario-based analysis
to evaluate how pricing, demand, and promotional assumptions impact future revenue outcomes
under uncertainty.

## Problem Statement
Businesses often rely on static reports or intuition for revenue planning.
This project addresses that gap by providing an explainable forecasting system
that supports forward-looking decision-making through scenario simulation.

## Key Objectives
- Forecast monthly revenue over a 12-month horizon
- Quantify uncertainty using confidence intervals
- Enable scenario planning for pricing and demand changes
- Support strategic planning decisions, not just predictions

## Project Structure
See the repository structure for modular separation between data processing,
modeling, API services, and frontend visualization.

## Status
🚧 In progress — foundational setup completed.
